Users should be able to log foods they've eaten each day, including details about the meal and its number of calories. You may assume foods being logged are for a single day (you are not required to keep track of multiple days' meals).

Uncompleted User Stories:

* I want to log a food I have eaten by submitting a form with food name, calories and details.

- new meal component

* I want options to view all foods, only high-calorie foods (more than 500 calories), or only lower-calorie foods (less than 500 calories).

- create pipe to filter by calories

* I want to click a food to edit its name, details or calories (in case I decide to pretend my fries were 100 calories instead of 365).

- create edit meal component
