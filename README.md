Users should be able to log foods they've eaten each day, including details about the meal and its number of calories. You may assume foods being logged are for a single day (you are not required to keep track of multiple days' meals).

Uncompleted User Stories:

* I want a property that records when each food was eaten. The user could enter a date and time, or the app can generate a timestamp.

Completed User Stories:

* I want to view a list of foods I have logged.
* I want to log a food I have eaten by submitting a form with food name, calories and details.
* I want to click a food to edit its name, details or calories (in case I decide to pretend my fries were 100 calories instead of 365).
* I want options to view all foods, only high-calorie foods (more than 500 calories), or only lower-calorie foods (less than 500 calories).
* I want the app to display details and calories when I mouse over a meal's name
* I want the edit feature to go away when I click a button
* I want the app to hide details/calories when I mouse away from a meal's name
* I want to display of the total number of calories consumed in a day
